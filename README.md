# SETS
Social Engineering Threat Scanner

A radar to better orient yourself in the world of cybersecurity of social engineering.

## Inspiration
The critical point in cybersecurity is always the human being, who must be trained and supported constantly with the right knowledge. Therefore, training and attention to cybersecurity, especially social engineering, is essentially the fundamental approach to knowing how to respond to threats.

## What it does
SETS with a simple interactive interface introduces the knowledge of the main social engineering techniques, suggesting the most appropriate remedies.

## How we built it
SETS has been designed to be usable in a direct and easy way, using standard web tools and without further framework complications, so that it can be hosted on any web server or even run locally.

## Challenges we ran into
Thinking and creating a simple and engaging interface for the world of cybersecurity, starting from social engineering, as well as expandable and easily upgradable, was the main goal of the SETS project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
SETS represents a first valid, thoughtful and immediately usable response for a large audience that requires awareness of the numerous social engineering techniques, so as to be able to remedy them in the most appropriate way.

## What we learned
SETS has allowed us to learn how to interact with AI to support software development, making the creative process more focused on the topic being addressed.

## What's next for SETS - Social Engineering Threat Scanner
The next updates of SETS will further expand the internal knowledge of the system so that it can be extended to other areas of cybersecurity in order to make it a tool for wide-ranging use, but always in an easy, fast and direct way.
